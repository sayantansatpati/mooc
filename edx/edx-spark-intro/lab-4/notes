Each line in the ratings dataset (ratings.dat.gz) is formatted as:
UserID::MovieID::Rating::Timestamp
Each line in the movies (movies.dat) dataset is formatted as:
MovieID::Title::Genres
The Genres field has the format
Genres1|Genres2|Genres3|...

Parsing the two files yields two RDDS

For each line in the ratings dataset, we create a tuple of (UserID, MovieID, Rating). We drop the timestamp because we do not need it for this exercise.

For each line in the movies dataset, we create a tuple of (MovieID, Title). We drop the Genres because we do not need them for this exercise.

(UserID, MovieID, Rating)
ratingsRDD = rawRatings.map(get_ratings_tuple).cache()

(MovieID, Title)
moviesRDD = rawMovies.map(get_movie_tuple).cache()

trainingRDD, validationRDD, testRDD = ratingsRDD.randomSplit([6, 2, 2], seed=0L)
